# Object Localization with Manual Annotation and CNN Training

## Overview

This repository contains two Python scripts for object localization tasks. The first script (`manual_annotation.py`) facilitates the manual annotation of bounding boxes around cat noses in images. The second script (`cnn_training.py`) is designed to load the annotated dataset, preprocess images, and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object localization.

## Manual Annotation Script (manual_annotation.py)

### Purpose

The purpose of this script is to allow users to manually annotate images by drawing bounding boxes around cat noses. The annotated bounding box coordinates are then saved to a CSV file for further use in training a machine learning model.

### Usage

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python (>=3.6)
   - OpenCV
   - Pandas

2. **Setup:**
   - Set the `image_folder_path` variable to the path containing cat images.
   - Set the `output_csv_path` variable to the desired output CSV file path.

3. **Annotation Process:**
   - Run the script.
   - Click on the cat nose and drag to draw a bounding box.
   - Press "c" to save the annotation and move on to the next image.

4. **Output:**
   - The script outputs a CSV file containing image filenames and corresponding bounding box coordinates.

## CNN Training Script (cnn_training.py)

### Purpose

This script is designed to load the annotated dataset generated using the manual annotation script, preprocess the images, and train a CNN for object localization. The CNN is trained to predict the bounding box coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) for cat noses in images.

### Usage

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python (>=3.6)
   - OpenCV
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - Scikit-learn
   - TensorFlow (>=2.0)

2. **Setup:**
   - Set the `annotations_csv_path` variable to the path of the CSV file generated by the manual annotation script.

3. **Training Process:**
   - Run the script.
   - The script loads images, preprocesses them, splits the dataset, defines a CNN model, and trains the model.
   - The model is trained to minimize the mean squared error between predicted and actual bounding box coordinates.

4. **Output:**
   - The trained model can be used for object localization tasks.

## Notes

- Adjust paths and parameters in the scripts based on your specific folder structures and requirements.
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
